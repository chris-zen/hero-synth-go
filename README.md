# hero-synth

The goal of this project is to create an audio synthesizer that is able to model Additive, Substractive and FM synthesis all in one. The idea is to add some basic units such as oscilators, LFOs, evelopes, filters and effects, and allow the user to route them using a kind of [matrix mixer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_mixer).

Before you continue looking into it, please bear in mind that my main motivation is to learn the Go language.

On the long term roadmap, if still motivated to continue it, I will convert it into a web app with audio streaming that allows to configure the instrument graphically and edit music using a matrix sequencer.
