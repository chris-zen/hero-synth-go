# hero-synth
The goal of this project is to create an audio synthesizer that is able to model Additive, Substractive and FM synthesis all in one. The idea is to add some basic units such as oscilators, LFOs, evelopes, filters and effects, and allow the user to route them using a kind of matrix mixer.
